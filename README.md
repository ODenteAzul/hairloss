## Hair Loss Causes Study

### Background
As we age, hair loss becomes one of the health concerns of many people. The fullness of hair not only affects appearance, but is also closely related to an individual's health. A survey brings together a variety of factors that may contribute to hair loss, including genetic factors, hormonal changes, medical conditions, medications, nutritional deficiencies, psychological stress, and more. Through data exploration and analysis, the potential correlation between these factors and hair loss can be deeply explored and predicted, thereby providing a useful reference for the development of individual health management, medical intervention, and related industries.

This is a study to try identify causes for hair loss
